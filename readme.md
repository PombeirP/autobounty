#### Aragon Autobounty bot for CommitETH
A Github bot that will automatically fund issues that are tagged with  **[bounty](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-core/labels/bounty)**.
These bounties will use [CommitETH](http://commiteth.com) to incentivize community members to participate and contribute to  the development of Aragon.

Open source is awesome, but it is also hard work that needs to be rewarded to ensure top quality work, and that everyone in the world gets a fair chance to do it.

#### ðŸ¦‹ We at Aragon are using [CommitETH](http://commiteth.com) to reward open source contributions outside the Aragon Core team.
All issues tagged with **[bounty](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-core/labels/bounty)** are eligible for a bounty on a succesfully merged Pull Request that solves the issue. Even if the bounty says 0 ETH, if it has the **bounty** label, it is higher than 0 ETH, this bot is created to automate this process of funding these issues so contributors can be rewarded accordingly.

#### The process

- An **[issue](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-core/issues)** is created at the repo
- Issue is labeled with **[bounty](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-core/labels/bounty)**
- [CommitETH](http://commiteth.com) bot adds a bounty to the issue and it is displayed in the issue's comments
- This autobounty bot automatically funds that issue with a set amount of Ether, so when a successful Pull Request is merged, the contributor is paid that amount for their work.
